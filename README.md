# Short-term Occupational Employment Projections Report - A Data Analytics Report
By Pham Duy Anh Vu

## Introduction
Occupational employment projections data is an integral part of the governmentâ€™s database. This methodology is developed in the Labor Market Information (LMI) sections of each State Employment Security Agency (SESA) to gather information about the staffing patterns used in projections, employment change, occupational openings, education, training, and wages for each detailed National Employment Matrix occupation.

Developed by the California Employment Development Department, this dataset is about the short-term projections about occupational employment for a 2-year time horizon produced by the state of California for individuals and organizations with an occupational outlook to make informed decisions on careers and development. It is comprised of 18 different variables and a total of 755 objects, ranging from different job qualifications (entry level education, work experience, total job openings) to the specifics of the business cycles of each job (base and projected quarter employment estimate, exits, transfers, wages)

Using R and RStudio, this report will go more in depth, classifying, showing the purpose and relationship between each factor.
